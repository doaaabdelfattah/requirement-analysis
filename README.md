# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This repository is dedicated to exploring the critical phase of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle. Requirement Analysis involves understanding, documenting, and managing the expectations of stakeholders for a software project.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a fundamental phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, evaluating, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.
It sets the foundation for the project, ensuring the development team understands what needs to be built, why, and how it aligns with business goals.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
